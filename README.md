## About :computer:

Task Tracker CLI is a project used to track and manage your tasks. You can add, update and delete tasks, mark a task as in progress or done, and list all tasks, tasks that are done, tasks that are not done, and tasks that are in progress. The tasks are stored in a JSON file in the current directory.
